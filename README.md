## Edit and Watch Source Code

```
cd src
npm install
npm run watch
```

Now, we can edit and save any files in `src` of root directory, the new folder called `dist` will be built in root directory.

## Debug Source Code at App Environment

```
cd ..
cd app/demo-cjs
npm install
npm run start

When the `dist` is built by changing the source code, the app in the browser will referesh immediately, and we will see the latest changes of the source code at app.
